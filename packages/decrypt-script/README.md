## Offline

As part of our mission to keep your data safe for the next hundred years, we want to ensure you have the right tools to handle worst-case scenarios.

The encryption algorithms involved in securing your data are completely open-source and non-proprietary, so you don't have to rely on us for your data to be safe and valid.

To further your protections against general disruptions in your network or ours, we've created a single page offline decryption tool that can run in any browser.

### Decrypting a Backup Offline

[Download the offline decrypt script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/standardfile/decrypt/master/dist/decrypt.html) and open it with any browser.

You can right click the link above and choose "Save link as", or open the page directly and save the page with Cmd/Ctrl + S.

_Always make sure you get this script from a trusted source, such as our website._

### Creating Backups

There are two ways to create backups of your note data:

1. Manual: In the "Account" menu of the Standard Notes app, in the lower left corner, you will see options for downloading encrypted or decrypted archives of your data.

2. Automatic: [Our Extended subscription](https://standardnotes.org/extensions) creates automatic and real-time backups of all your data to your Dropbox, OneDrive, and Google Drive, with other cloud providers being added soon.

## Building the script yourself

This script was built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14. Make sure it is installed on your system.
Then, in the repo, run the following commands:

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn run build`

(You can replace `yarn` with `npm` if you want)


This will output a new `dist/decrypt.html` file.
