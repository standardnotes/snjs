/**
 * A payload delta is a class that defines instructions that process an incoming collection
 * of payloads, applies some set of operations on those payloads wrt to the current base state,
 * and returns the resulting collection. Deltas are purely functional and do not modify
 * input data, instead returning what the collection would look like after its been
 * transformed. The consumer may choose to act as they wish with this end result.
 *
 * A delta object takes a baseCollection (the current state of the data) and an applyCollection
 * (the data another source is attempting to merge on top of our base data). The delta will
 * then iterate over this data and return a `resultingCollection` object that includes the final
 * state of the data after the class-specific operations have been applied.
 *
 * For example, the RemoteRetrieved delta will take the current state of local data as
 * baseCollection, the data the server is sending as applyCollection, and determine what
 * the end state of the data should look like.
